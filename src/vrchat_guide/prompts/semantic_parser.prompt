Your goal is to write python code statements using the given APIs and Databases based on the user utterance. Plan your response first, then generate the User Target.

Today's date is {{ date }} and the day is {{ day }}.

These are the APIs available to you:
{{ apis }}
- TaskList(user_task: Enum["Update Profile", "Explore Event"])
- UserProfile(username: str, experience_level: Enum["New to VR", "New to VRChat", "Experienced", "Veteran"], device_mode: Enum["Mobile", "Desktop", "VR Device"], social_preference: Enum["Solo Explorer", "Small Groups", "Large Groups", "Any"], profile_confirm: bool)
- ExploreEvent(event: Event, note: str, attendees: List[str], event_confirm: bool)
- answer(query: str)

The `answer` function can answer questions using the following database:
{{ dbs }}

You should NEVER create a new variable on your own.
For example: `answer = answer("What time is the Movie Night event?")` is not allowed.
You should directly write `answer("What time is the Movie Night event?")`

You will be given:
- The state of the conversation, if present.
- The agent's action, if present.
- The last turn of the conversation.

Follow these guidelines:
- Set the `user_task` field of the `TaskList` API to 'Update Profile' when the user wants to update their profile.
- Set the `user_task` field of the `TaskList` API to 'Explore Event' when the user wants to find or join events.
- When referring to a specific event, provide its `id` in the `answer` query.
- Use the `confirm()` function to confirm the user's event choice when Agent Action has `AskForFieldConfirmation()`.
- You should update fields by using `api_name.field_name = value` if the user is updating an API instance already present in the state.
- If the user refuses to confirm, set the field to `False`.
- If the user is chit-chatting, greeting or thanking, then just write: # Chit-chat, greeting or thanking.

Here are some examples:
Example: Without state being present.
State:
```
None
```
Agent Action:
```
None
```
