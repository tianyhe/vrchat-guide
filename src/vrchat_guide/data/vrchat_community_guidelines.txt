1. General Conduct

Respect Others: Always be mindful and respectful of other users. Avoid offensive language, harassment, or any form of hate speech. Treat everyone with courtesy and patience, even in disagreements.
Inclusivity: VRChat is a diverse platform where people from various backgrounds connect. Be welcoming, and do not discriminate based on race, gender, religion, or other personal attributes.
Personal Boundaries: Respect personal space and boundaries. Consent is crucial in all interactions—always ask before joining someone's space or engaging in direct interactions.
2. Avatar and Content Guidelines

Appropriate Avatars: Choose avatars that are appropriate for a broad audience. Avoid using avatars with offensive, suggestive, or violent imagery, as well as avatars that may make others uncomfortable.
Original Content: When creating and sharing content, follow copyright and intellectual property laws. Do not use avatars, worlds, or assets created by others without permission.
Avoid Overly Flashy or Distracting Designs: Avatars or props that are overly bright, flashing, or large can cause discomfort or lag for others. Use such designs sparingly and only when suitable.
3. Communication and Chat Etiquette

Use Clear Communication: Whether in voice or text, aim for clear and respectful communication. Avoid spamming, interrupting, or dominating conversations, as VRChat is a shared space.
Limit Profanity and Slang: Excessive profanity or overly niche slang can alienate other users. Use considerate language and be open to others’ communication styles.
Mute When Needed: If others ask you to mute your microphone or reduce background noise, please respect their requests. This makes for a more enjoyable experience for all participants.
4. Privacy and Safety

Respect User Anonymity: Many users value their privacy and anonymity. Do not ask for or share personal information (e.g., full names, contact info) without permission.
Secure Login Credentials: Protect your account information and avoid sharing login details with others. VRChat staff will never ask for your password.
Report Suspicious Behavior: If you notice suspicious behavior, such as someone attempting to collect personal information from multiple users, report it to VRChat staff.
5. Role-Playing and Theming

Respect Role-Playing Boundaries: Many users enjoy role-playing or themed interactions. Respect these choices and follow the boundaries they set within their scenarios.
Avoid Unwanted Role Play: Ensure others are comfortable with your role-play style before interacting. Not everyone wants to participate in role-play, so gauge the situation.
Respect World Themes: Each world in VRChat may have a unique theme or ambiance. Be mindful of the atmosphere and avoid disruptive behavior that may diminish the intended experience.
6. Performance and Technical Courtesy

Limit High-Resource Avatars in Public Spaces: Overly complex avatars can slow down performance in populated worlds. Switch to more performance-friendly avatars when possible in busy areas.
Optimize for Low-End Systems: VRChat aims to be accessible to a wide audience, including those with lower-end systems. Minimize particle effects, shaders, and dynamic lighting in shared spaces.
Report Bugs, Don’t Exploit: If you encounter bugs or performance issues, report them instead of exploiting them. Glitches that disrupt others’ experiences should be avoided.
7. Hosting and Event Etiquette

Respect Host Rules: If you’re in a hosted event or world, follow the rules set by the host. They’ve likely crafted an experience and expect participants to maintain it.
Be a Welcoming Guest: Treat every VRChat experience as if you’re a guest in someone else’s space. Participate politely and avoid dominating the conversation unless invited.
Encourage Positive Engagement: In any gathering, encourage others to feel included. Foster a positive environment that invites others to share and participate freely.
8. Conflict Resolution

Avoid Confrontation: VRChat is meant for connection and fun. If you have a disagreement, avoid direct confrontation and, if needed, mute or block users to maintain your peace.
Report Major Issues: For serious issues, such as harassment or violations of VRChat’s Terms of Service, report directly to VRChat’s moderation team.
Promote Constructive Conversations: Rather than arguing or fueling tension, encourage constructive conversation. Support others in problem-solving peacefully.
9. Contribution to the Community

Create and Share Mindfully: If you’re a creator, consider the impact your work will have on the community. Aim for contributions that enhance the overall experience for others.
Help New Users: VRChat can be daunting for newcomers. If you encounter someone who seems new, offer friendly guidance and help them get familiar with the platform.
Engage Positively: Every user’s actions contribute to VRChat’s community culture. Set a positive example, inspire creativity, and uplift others.
