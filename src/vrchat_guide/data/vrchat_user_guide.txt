1. Beginner Level: Getting Started

Welcome to VRChat! If you’re new to the platform, this section will guide you through setting up, exploring your first worlds, and connecting with others.

Setting Up Your Account: Start by creating a VRChat account or logging in through your preferred platform (Steam, Oculus, etc.). Customize your settings for audio, visuals, and comfort before you begin exploring.
Choosing an Avatar: Pick an avatar that represents you. You can choose from default avatars in the VRChat hub, or search community worlds for unique avatars to try on. Remember to select a user-friendly avatar if you’re in a crowded space.
Exploring Worlds: Use the VRChat menu to browse “Popular” or “New” worlds and get a feel for the variety available. Start with VRChat Home, where you can practice moving around and adjusting your settings.
Basic Movement Controls: Learn to walk, jump, and interact with objects. In VR mode, hand gestures and controllers give more control over movement and interaction. Take some time to get familiar with your controls.
Basic Communication: If you’re ready, enable your microphone to communicate with others. Practice speaking clearly, and remember you can use emojis to communicate without voice.
2. Intermediate Level: Socializing and Personalization

Now that you’re familiar with the basics, it’s time to dive deeper into VRChat’s social world. This level will cover meeting people, using custom avatars, and exploring community events.

Meeting Other Users: VRChat is a social platform, so don’t hesitate to approach others and start conversations. Begin with popular worlds where users often gather, like “The Black Cat” or “Pug Club.”
Customizing Your Avatar: Intermediate users often like exploring custom avatars. Many avatar worlds offer unique, downloadable avatars. Experiment with different looks and expressions, but be considerate of performance impact in large spaces.
Voice and Text Chat Etiquette: VRChat is a global community, so keep your language friendly and respectful. If you’re not comfortable speaking, you can use text chat, gestures, or emojis.
Exploring Social Worlds: Social worlds offer different vibes and activities. Some focus on casual hangouts, while others may have games or themed events. Experiment with different social settings to find your comfort zone.
Joining and Hosting Events: VRChat regularly hosts events like karaoke nights, movie screenings, and dance parties. Join these events to meet new friends and experience unique activities. You can also host private gatherings by creating instances of worlds and inviting friends.
3. Advanced Level: Content Creation and Customization

As you become more comfortable, you may want to start creating or modifying content. Advanced users often create avatars, design worlds, and set up VRChat for a personalized experience.

Using Unity for Avatar and World Creation: If you’re ready to create your own avatars or worlds, learn the basics of Unity (a 3D engine used by VRChat creators). Start with VRChat’s SDK, which provides tools for creating custom content.
Creating Custom Avatars: Advanced users often make their own avatars using software like Blender and import them through Unity. Learn about VRChat’s avatar requirements to ensure compatibility.
Building Worlds: Creating a custom world allows you to design unique environments for others to explore. Consider starting small with simple rooms or environments, then build up to more complex designs as you learn.
Avatar and World Optimization: Ensure that your custom content doesn’t cause performance issues. Learn about polycount, dynamic bones, shaders, and textures to keep your creations optimized.
Configuring VRChat Settings for Optimal Performance: Experiment with VRChat’s performance settings. You can adjust particle effects, avatar visibility, and other settings to create a smooth experience, especially in crowded worlds.
4. Expert Level: Advanced Features and Community Contribution

If you’re an experienced user, you may want to contribute to the VRChat community by organizing events, optimizing large-scale worlds, or creating new tools and resources.

Hosting Large-Scale Events: Expert users can host or even organize VRChat community events. Plan events, set up world instances, and manage participants to create memorable gatherings.
Advanced Scripting for World Interactivity: Use Udon (VRChat’s scripting language) to add interactive features to worlds, like puzzles, games, and complex animations. Learning Udon can make your worlds stand out and offer new experiences.
Creating Unique Interactive Experiences: Advanced creators use Unity and Udon to create games, role-playing worlds, or escape rooms. Experiment with scripts, triggers, and animations to add complexity.
Supporting New Users: As an experienced VRChatter, you can support the community by helping newcomers navigate VRChat, troubleshoot issues, or even teach them basic creation techniques.
Contributing to VRChat Resources: Share knowledge by creating tutorials, guides, or assets that others can use. Many advanced users help by making avatar bases, world templates, or educational resources for fellow creators.
Building Cross-Platform Experiences: As VRChat is available across multiple platforms, expert creators can design content optimized for both VR and desktop users, making sure that everyone has a great experience, regardless of their setup.
