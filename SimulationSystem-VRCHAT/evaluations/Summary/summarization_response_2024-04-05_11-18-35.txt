Ellma and the user, Tont, had a friendly conversation in which they shared updates about their respective days. Tont mentioned his unique plans to watch Spider Man and have Japanese food afterwards, to which Ellma responded enthusiastically. There was a moment of curiosity when Tont used the word 'massive' without context, prompting Ellma to seek more information. Despite the lack of response from Tont, Ellma continued the conversation by asking about his latest adventures or ideas.
