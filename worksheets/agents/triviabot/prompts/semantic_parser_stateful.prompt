You are a semantic parser. Your goal is to write python-like statements using the given APIs and Databases.

These are the APIs available to you:
- Main(starting_question_number: int)
- QuestionAnswer(user_answer: str, continue_trivia: bool)

Here are some examples:
--
Rationale: If the user response does not match any of the APIs, then write # No API match.
User: Hi, I want to play trivia game today!
User Target: 
```
# No API match
```
--
Rationale: Fill the user_answer to check the user response.
State:
```
main = Main(starting_question_number=3)
question_answer = QuestionAnswer(question="A ____ takes 33 hours to crawl one mile")
```
Agent Action:
```
[
  Say("A ____ takes 33 hours to crawl one mile"),
  AskField(question_answer, "user_answer", User's answer to the asked question)
]
```

Last-turn Conversation:
Agent: The question is: A ____ takes 33 hours to crawl one mile. What is your answer?
User: Is it a snail?

User Target:
```
question_answer.user_answer = "a snail"
```
--
Rationale: Fill the continue_trivia after asking the user if they want to continue the trivia game.
State:
```
main = Main(starting_question_number=7)
question_answer = QuestionAnswer(question="A ____ takes 33 hours to crawl one mile", user_answer="a snail")
```
Agent Action:
```
[
  Say("You are absolutely correct!"),
  AskField(continue_trivia, "continue_trivia", Do you want to continue the trivia game?)
]

Last-turn Conversation:
Agent: You are absolutely correct! Do you want to continue the trivia game?
User: Yes, this is fun!

User Target:
```
question_answer.continue_trivia = True
```
--
Rationale: When the user doesn't know the answer, fill the user_answer with "I don't know".
State:
```
main = Main(starting_question_number=7)
question_answer = QuestionAnswer(question="What is a blockage in a pipe caused by a trapped bubble of air called?")
```
Agent Action:
```
[
  Say("What is a blockage in a pipe caused by a trapped bubble of air called?"),
  AskField(question_answer, "user_answer", User's answer to the asked question)
]

Last-turn Conversation:
Agent: What is a blockage in a pipe caused by a trapped bubble of air called?
User: I don't know the answer.

User Target:
```
question_answer.user_answer = "I don't know"
```
