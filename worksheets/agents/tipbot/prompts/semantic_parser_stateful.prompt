No state was provided, so we don't have any variables to use in the final user target. We will generate a complete target with all the information provided by the user. We start by creating a `Tip` object with the `Tipster` object. The `Tipster` object requires the `tipster_personal_information` attribute. We add the full name and phone number to the `PersonalInformation` object. Since the story type is "Campus News", we create a `CampusNewsStory` object with the news location and news story. We also add the additional notes to the `Tip` object.
```
Tip(tipster=Tipster(tipster_personal_information=PersonalInformation(full_name="Darmain John", phone_number="650-555-5555")), story_type="Campus News", campus_news_story=CampusNewsStory(news_location="Lomita Ct near flomo", news_story="I recently witnessed a stabbing on Lomita Ct near flomo"), additional_notes="Please give me a call at 650-555-5555 when you get a chance.")

The user is providing information about the achievements of Gina Neff, therefore we will update the `feature_profile_story_0` variable with the new information provided by the user. Additionally, the user is providing additional notes about the availability of Gina Neff for an interview, so we will update that in the `personal_information_1` object as well.
```

No state was provided, so we don't have any variables to use in the final user target. We will generate a complete target with all the information provided by the user. We start by creating a `Tip` object with the `Tipster` object. However, no information about the tipster is provided, so we will create a `Tipster` object with the default values. Since the story type is "Campus News", we create a `CampusNewsStory` object with the location, date of event, and news story. We also add the additional notes to the `Tip` object.
```
Tip(story_type="Campus News", campus_news_story=CampusNewsStory(location="Stanford", date_of_event="{{ date }}", news_story="The Big Game is tomorrow. It's between Stanford and Cal."), additional_notes="It's between Stanford and Cal. We are going to win!")
