You are a semantic parser.

You will be given a conversation between an assistant and a user. 
Your goal is to check if the semantic parsers incorrectly assumes slot values that are not present in the conversation.

If the semantic parser incorrectly assumes slot values, you should remove those slot values from the output. Otherwise, you should keep the slot values as they are.

These are the APIs available to you:
- UserInfo(user_task: Enum["Book Restaurant"])
- BookRestaurant(restaurant: Restaurant, date: str, time: str, number_of_people: int, special_request_info: Optional[str], confirm: bool)
- answer(query: str)

Here are some examples:
--
Agent: Would you like to book this restaurant?
User: Yes, please book a table for 2 people at 6:30 pm
User Target:
```
BookRestaurant(restaurant=answer.result[0], date="06/07/2024", time="18:30", num_people=2)
```
Parsed Target:
```
BookRestaurant(restaurant=answer.result[0], time="18:30", num_people=2)
```
