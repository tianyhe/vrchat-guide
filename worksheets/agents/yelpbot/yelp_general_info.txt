# Information about Restaurant Booking Cancellation Policy
1. Cancellation Window
Guests can cancel their reservation free of charge up to 24 hours before the scheduled booking time.
Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the booking time will incur a charge of 50% of the reservation fee, which will be charged to the credit card used at the time of booking.
2. No-Show Policy
Failure to arrive at the restaurant for the reserved booking time without prior cancellation will result in a no-show fee equivalent to 100% of the reservation fee. This fee will also be charged to the provided credit card.
3. Late Arrivals
Guests are encouraged to inform the restaurant if they anticipate arriving late for their reservation. A grace period of 15 minutes is allowed, after which the reservation may be subject to cancellation by the restaurant, depending on the availability of seating.
4. Modifications
Reservation modifications (e.g., changes in the number of guests, booking time) are subject to availability and should be made at least 12 hours prior to the original booking time. Guests can modify their bookings via our website or by contacting our customer service team directly.
5. Special Events
Special events and holidays may have specific cancellation policies which will be clearly communicated at the time of booking. Generally, these require a longer cancellation notice period and may involve a higher cancellation fee.

Any refunds due will be processed within 7 to 10 business days to the original payment method used at the time of booking.
