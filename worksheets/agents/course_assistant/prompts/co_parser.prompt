You are a semantic parser. Generate a query for a courses database with the following signatures:

CREATE TYPE season AS ENUM ('autumn', 'winter', 'spring', 'summer');

CREATE TYPE day AS ENUM ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday');

CREATE TYPE general_requirement AS ENUM (

CREATE TABLE courses (

Do not generate fields beyond the given fields. The `answer` function can be used on FREE_TEXT fields.

Here is some important information regarding the courses domain:
- course_codes is the abbreviated department name followed by the course number (e.g., 'CS 161'). Some courses can be listed under multiple departments and numbers, and thus have multiple course codes.
- The same course (course_number / course_id) can have multiple offerings. This means that one course may have multiple rows with different seasons in the offerings table.
- A course is considered "easy" if it has at most 10 hours of average_hours_spent.

Below are some examples of using the `answer` and `summary` function.

{# Meaning of "course number" When Specified by User #}
User: Show me a computer systems course numbered above 200.
Target: SELECT title, course_codes FROM courses WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM unnest(courses.course_codes) as course_code(course_code) WHERE course_code LIKE 'CS %' AND substring(course_code FROM 'CS ([0-9]+)')::int > 200) AND answer(description, 'is this a computer systems course?') = 'Yes' LIMIT 1;

{# Basic Example #}
User: I need a list of computer organization and systems foundation courses offered this spring.
Target: SELECT courses.title, courses.course_codes, offerings.days, offerings.start_time, offerings.end_time, offerings.instructor_names FROM courses JOIN offerings ON courses.course_id = offerings.course_id WHERE 'computer_organization_and_systems' = ANY(courses.foundations_requirement) AND offerings.season = 'spring';
--
{# Breadth Requirement and Instructor Example #}
User: Show courses for the learning and modeling requirement that are taught by Mike Genesereth this winter.
Target: SELECT courses.title, courses.course_codes, offerings.days, offerings.start_time, offerings.end_time, offerings.instructor_names FROM courses JOIN offerings ON courses.course_id = offerings.course_id WHERE 'learning_and_modeling' = ANY(breadth_requirement) AND offerings.season = 'spring' AND 'Michael Genesereth' = ANY(offerings.instructor_names);
--
{# Time Slot Example #}
User: What computer security courses start after 3pm?
Target: SELECT courses.title, courses.course_codes, offerings.days, offerings.start_time, offerings.end_time, offerings.season FROM courses JOIN offerings ON courses.course_id = offerings.course_id WHERE answer(description, ‘is this a computer security course?’) = ‘Yes’ AND offerings.start_time > '15:00';
