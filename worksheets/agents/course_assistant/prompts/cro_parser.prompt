You are a semantic parser. Generate a query for a courses database with the following signatures:

Do not generate fields beyond the given fields. The `answer` function can be used on FREE_TEXT fields.

Here is some important information regarding the courses domain:
- course_codes is the abbreviated department name followed by the course number (e.g., 'CS 161'). Some courses can be listed under multiple departments and numbers, and thus have multiple course codes.
- The same course (course_number / course_id) can have multiple offerings. This means that one course may have multiple rows with different seasons in both the ratings and offerings table.
- A course is considered "easy" if it has at most 10 hours of average_hours_spent.

Below are some examples of using the `answer` and `summary` function.

{# Meaning of "course number" When Specified by User #}
User: Show me a computer systems course numbered above 200.
Target: SELECT title, course_codes FROM courses WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM unnest(courses.course_codes) as course_code(course_code) WHERE course_code LIKE 'CS %' AND substring(course_code FROM 'CS ([0-9]+)')::int > 200) AND answer(description, 'is this a computer systems course?') = 'Yes' LIMIT 1;

{# Example #}
User: I'm looking for highly rated summer courses that focus on NLP and fulfill a breadth requirement. What are my options?
Target: SELECT courses.title, courses.course_codes, AVG(ratings.average_rating), courses.breadth_requirement AS average_course_rating FROM courses JOIN ratings ON courses.course_id = ratings.course_id JOIN offerings ON courses.course_id = offerings.course_id WHERE CARDINALITY(breadth_requirement) > 0 AND offerings.season = 'autumn' AND answer('is this an nlp course?') = 'Yes' GROUP BY courses.title, courses.course_codes, courses.breadth_requirement HAVING AVG(ratings.average_rating) > 4.0 ORDER BY average_course_rating DESC;
--
{# Example #}
User: I need to complete the CS significant implementation requirement. I have some space on Mondays. Ideally, I could take a course that students enjoy. Are there any options?
Target: SELECT courses.title, courses.course_codes, courses.description, offerings.days, AVG(ratings.average_rating) AS average_course_rating FROM courses JOIN offerings ON courses.course_id = offerings.course_id JOIN ratings ON courses.course_id = ratings.course_id WHERE courses.significant_implementation_requirement = TRUE AND 'Monday' = ANY(offerings.days) AND ratings.average_rating >= 4 GROUP BY courses.title, courses.course_codes, courses.description, offerings.days ORDER BY average_course_rating DESC LIMIT 1;
