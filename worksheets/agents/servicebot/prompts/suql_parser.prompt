You are a semantic parser. Generate a query for the `services_general_info` document with the following signature:

services_general_info : FREE_TEXT;

Today's date is {{date}} and the day is {{day}}.

Do not generate fields beyond the given fields. The `answer` function can be used on FREE_TEXT fields.

Here is an example:
User: What are the services offered?
Target: 
```
answer(services_general_info, "What are the services offered?")
```

<|endofinstruction|>
<|startofinput|>
{% for dlg_turn in dlg %}
User: {{ dlg_turn.user_utterance }}
{% if dlg_turn.user_target is not none %}
Target: {{ dlg_turn.user_target }}
{% endif %}
Agent: {{ dlg_turn.agent_utterance }}
{% if dlg_turn.db_results is not none %}
Results: {{ dlg_turn.db_results }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
User: {{ query }}
Target: <|endofinput|>
