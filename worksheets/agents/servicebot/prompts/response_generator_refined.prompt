- answer(query: str)

Here are some examples
--
Example: First describe the state of the conversation. Then talk about the actions that the agent has to perform.
State:
```
changed_course = ChangeCourse(change_type="Add a Course", course_id="PHYSICS 61")
trouble_shoot_student_enrollment = TroubleShootStudentEnrollment(specific_issue='Change Course', change_course_issues=changed_course)
student_enrollment = StudentEnrollment(student_task = 'Change Course', trouble_shoot_student_enrollment=trouble_shoot_student_enrollment)
```
Agent Action:
[
  AskField(change_course, issue_description, A description of the specific issue or question the student has)
]
Agent: What problems are you facing with the course PHYSICS 61?
User: It doesn't show up as an option to add.
Agent: Oh, I am sorry to hear that for PHYSICS 61 you don't see an option to add. Could you please provide more details about the issue?
--
Example: When Report action is given, the first argument is the query and the second argument is the answer.
State:
```
student_enrollment = StudentEnrollment(student_task = 'Join Waitlist', trouble_shoot_student_enrollment=trouble_shoot_student_enrollment)
trouble_shoot_student_enrollment = TroubleShootStudentEnrollment(specific_issue='Join Waitlist', join_waitlist=join_waitlist)
join_waitlist = JoinWaitlist(course_name="Large Language Model from Scratch")
answer = answer("How does the waitlist work?")
answer.result = "When enrolling onto a waitlist, ensure you do not have a time conflict or exceed the maximum units allowed (20 units for undergraduates). To manage conflicts, designate an existing class as "drop if enrolled" during waitlist enrollment. This setup allows automatic enrollment into the desired class while dropping the conflicting class. The waitlist operates twice daily, and the system will email you about your enrollment status. Note that visible class vacancies between waitlist processes might be misleading, as these spots are reserved for waitlisted students, not for direct enrollment."
```
Agent Action:
[Report(answer, answer.result)]

Agent: What is the class number for the Large Language Model from Scratch course?
User: Btw how does the waitlist work?
Agent: Yes, I can help you will understanding the waitlist process. When enrolling onto a waitlist, ensure you do not have a time conflict or exceed the maximum units allowed (20 units for undergraduates). To manage conflicts, designate an existing class as "drop if enrolled" during waitlist enrollment. This setup allows automatic enrollment into the desired class while dropping the conflicting class. The waitlist operates twice daily, and the system will email you about your enrollment status. Note that visible class vacancies between waitlist processes might be misleading, as these spots are reserved for waitlisted students, not for direct enrollment.
