Double-check the [Academic Calendar](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/calendar/academic-dates \"Academic Dates\") for date and time of enrollment open.\n*   Do you have an enrollment hold? If you do, it will be displayed on your Axess home page in the **Holds, To Do's and Notifications** section. Click on the hold for additional details. There\u2019s typically an action you\u2019ll need to take to remove the enrollment hold.\n*   Are you on a Leave of Absence? Is your student status discontinued? If so, you won\u2019t be able to enroll. You can find [pertinent resources here](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/time-away-stanford-leave-withdraw-return \"Time Away from Stanford: Leave, Withdraw, Return\"). \n\nIf the enrollment tool isn\u2019t working as expected...\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nHere are the basic troubleshooting steps:\n\nStep 1: CRITICAL: Remove any remaining \"planned\" classes. ",
    "Sometimes these class picks can interfere with new enrollment.\n\nStep 2: CRITICAL: Axess is notoriously cache-sensitive. After clearing your planned classes, clear your browser cache, close your browser completely, and retry Axess.\n\nStep 3: Try the other enrollment tool. ",
    "If steps 1 and 2 didn\u2019t help, remember that you have two enrollment tools: **SimpleEnroll** and **Enroll (Alternate)**. If [SimpleEnroll (link is external)](https://simpleenroll.stanford.edu/) isn\u2019t working as expected, try Enroll (Alternate) (or vice versa). See below for how-to links:\n\n*   [How to Use SimpleEnroll](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/enroll-classes/how-do-i-enroll-through-simpleenroll \"How Do I Enroll through SimpleEnroll?\")\n*   [How to use Enroll (Alternate)](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/enroll-classes/how-do-i-enroll-through-enroll-alternate \"How Do I Enroll through Enroll (Alternate)?\") \n\nIf you can\u2019t enroll in a specific class...\n------------------------------------------\n\n### It looks like there should be space in the class. Why won\u2019t the system allow me to enroll?\n\nIn a \u201ccombined section\u201d class, the overall enrollment cap is fed by multiple sections. When you review the real-time enrollment data for a single section, it may look as if there are spaces available. However, if you try to enroll and the system indicates that the course is full, it\u2019s because those spaces are actually filled by students enrolling in the course\u2019s other \u201ccombined section(s).\u201d You may need to add yourself to the waitlist, or choose another class.\n\n### How does the waitlist process work? \n\nThe waitlist can't enroll you if you have a time conflict, or if adding the class would exceed the maximum allowable units (i.e., 20 units for undergraduates).\n\nWhen you're initially enrolling onto a waitlist, you can _avoid_ these problems by designating your existing class as a \"**drop if enrolled**\" class at the time when you enroll onto the waitlist. With the \"drop if enrolled\" class designation, you will be eligible to be enrolled off the waitlist into your desired class and simultaneously dropped from your conflicting class.\n\nThe waitlist process is typically run twice a day, and the system will send an email letting you know whether it was able to enroll you. If there was no spot for you, the system will alert you that you have not been enrolled.\n\nPlease note that when the waitlist is _between processes_, if other students drop the course, it can appear as if there are spaces in the class. However, you may not be able to add to the class roster because the system is waiting to run the waitlist. If there is space available on the waitlist, you may instead add yourself to the waitlist.\n\n### What if I\u2019m on the waitlist but have a time conflict? \n\nThe waitlist process is typically run twice a day, and the system will send an email letting you know whether it was able to enroll you. If there was no spot for you, the system will alert you that you have not been enrolled.\n\n_Even if a spot opens up, the system cannot enroll you from the waitlist if you have a time conflict with another course. Despite the auto messaging, there is no way to \u201coverride the time conflict.\u201d_\n\nIf you have a time conflict, you may drop the time-conflict course, wait to be enrolled from the waitlist if a spot opens up, and then re-enroll in the course you dropped.\n\nPlease note, in the future you can avoid this issue by designating your existing class as a \"**drop if enrolled**\" class at the time when you enroll onto the waitlist. With the \"drop if enrolled\" class designation, you will be eligible to be enrolled off the waitlist into your desired class and simultaneously dropped from your conflicting class.\n\n### What if I\u2019m on the waitlist but at the max unit limit?\n\nThe waitlist process is typically run twice a day, and the system will send an email letting you know whether it was able to enroll you. If there was no spot for you, the system will alert you that you have not been enrolled.\n\n_Even if a spot opens up, the system cannot enroll you from the waitlist if this would put you over the max unit limit._\n\nYou may drop another class to reduce your overall credit load, then wait to be enrolled from the waitlist if a spot opens up.\n\nPlease note, in the future you can avoid this issue by designating your existing class as a \"**drop if enrolled**\" class at the time when you enroll onto the waitlist. With the \"drop if enrolled\" class designation, you will be eligible to be enrolled off the waitlist into your desired class and simultaneously dropped from your conflicting class.\n\n### Why doesn\u2019t my permission number work? \n\nEach permission number pertains to a specific class in a specific quarter, and is valid for only one use. For example, if you enrolled in the course using a valid permission number but then dropped the class, you won\u2019t be able to use that same number to re-enroll. Or, if the permission number pertains to that specific class \u2013 but for a prior quarter \u2013 it won\u2019t allow you to enroll. Or, if the permission number pertains to another section of a \"combined section\" class \u2013 but not to the section you\u2019re trying to enroll \u2013 it won\u2019t work.\n\nIf your permission number is not working, you\u2019ll need to contact the professor/department who gave it to you in order to request a new permission number that is linked to the specific course and valid for this specific term.\n\n### I\u2019m an undergraduate student, is there any troubleshooting help specific to my program?\n\n",
    "Undergraduate students can reference these [troubleshooting tips (link is external)](https://advising.stanford.edu/current-students/advising-student-handbook/enrollment-problems) from Academic Advising.\n\n### I\u2019m a dual-degree graduate student, and Axess won\u2019t let me drop a class. Why not?\n\nAxess does not allow dual-degree students to drop below the unit minimum in either career, even when enrollment across both careers would still be considered full-time. In order to drop a course, you will need to complete the Multiple Career Enrollment Change request, located in the Student eForms portal. This will tell the Registrar's office which course you'd like to drop and they will manually make the change.\n\nTo access the form, log into Axess, then navigate to **Student eForms** (My Academics > Petitions & Forms).  In the eForms portal, search for \"Multiple Career Enrollment Change.\" The Registrar\u2019s Office quotes 3-5 business days for processing ([more information](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/more-resources/forms-processes \"Forms & Processes\")).\n\nTitle: Enrollment Overview\n\nURL Source: http://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/enroll-classes/enrollment-overview\n\nMarkdown Content:\nOn this page:\n\n*   \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b[Open Enrollment](#open)  \n*   [Waitlists](#Waitlists)\n*   [Permission Numbers](#Permission) \n*   [Unit Shaving](#unitshaving)\n\nOpen Enrollment\n---------------\n\nThe Open Enrollment period for each quarter begins when enrollment opens, and lasts through the Final Study List deadline.

    "View the course catalog and schedule of classes on the [ExploreCourses (link is external)](http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/) website. Information on degree requirements is available on the [Stanford Bulletin (link is external)](http://bulletin.stanford.edu/) website.\n\nPrior to enrollment each quarter, please keep in mind the following important considerations:\n\n*   Clear any holds blocking your registration; holds on registration may be viewed in Axess.\n*   Pay your tuition and fees; payment in full is due on the date indicated on the [University Bill (link is external)](https://mystudentbill.stanford.edu/). See the [Student Bill & Payment System](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-finances/understand-your-student-bill-and-payment-system \"Understand Your Student Bill and Payment System\") page for more information on payments.\n*   See your academic, departmental, or faculty advisers to discuss academic plans.\n\nEnrolling in courses is done in [Axess (link is external)](http://axess.sahr.stanford.edu/). Learn more about using Axess to enroll in courses by reviewing [Enrollment resources](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/enroll-classes/enrollment-troubleshooting \"Enrollment Troubleshooting\").\n\nWaitlists \n----------\n\nIf a class shows as full in Axess, you may be able to join a waitlist. If and when a spot opens up in the class, the first eligible student on the waitlist will automatically be added into the class.\n\nWaitlist eligibility (i.e., your eligibility to be added to the class) is based upon time conflicts, holds, and maximum units:\n\n*   If you have a time conflict (i.e., you are enrolled in another class that wholly or partially overlaps with the class for which you are on the waitlist), you will be bypassed and the next eligible student will be added.\n    *   You can avoid this issue by designating your existing class as a \"drop if enrolled\" class at the time when you enroll on the waitlist. With the \"drop if enrolled\" designation, you are eligible to  enroll into your desired class from the waitlist while simultaneously being dropped from your conflicting class.\n    *   If you are bypassed from the waitlist due to a time conflict with another enrolled class and did not select the \u2018drop if\u2019 option when enrolling, the only way to be selected from the waitlist is to drop the conflicting class until you have been successfully enrolled off of the waitlist. Once complete, you will maintain your placement on the waitlist.\n*   If enrolling in the class will take you above the maximum allowable units (i.e., 20 units for undergraduates), you will be bypassed and the next eligible student will be added.\n*   If you have an enrollment hold, you will be bypassed and the next eligible student will be added. You can review your hold details in [Axess (link is external)](https://axess.sahr.stanford.edu/). If needed, contact the [Student Services Center](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/get-help \"Get Help\") for more information about a hold on your enrollment.\n\nPermission Numbers\n------------------\n\nInstructors may choose to limit enrollment in their courses with permission numbers. There are two methods by which an instructor or a designated administrator can give you permission to enroll in a class with restricted enrollment: by number or by student.\n\n*   **By number**: Axess generates permission numbers which are given to you by a department administrator or instructor. You enter the permission number in Axess in order to be enrolled. Please see [How to Use SimpleEnroll](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/enroll-classes/how-do-i-enroll-through-simpleenroll \"How Do I Enroll through SimpleEnroll?\") to learn more.\n",
    "*   **By student**: A department administrator enters your student ID to grant permission allowing you to enroll.\n\nUnit Shaving\n------------\n\nOccasionally, a student may request permission to enroll in fewer units than the number associated with a course. This practice of \u201cunit shaving\u201d or unit adjustment is not permitted. Courses may be taken only for the number of units that are listed in Axess or [ExploreCourses (link is external)](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/). For example, a course offered for 5 units may only be taken for 5 units. Courses offered for variable units (e.g., 3-5 units) may be taken for the number of units chosen by the student with the stated range. Students should complete and be evaluated on the amount of work associated with the number of units they enrolled in. See the university policy, [Amount of Work](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/more-resources/student-policies/enrollment/registration-and-study-lists#amount-work), in the Student Policies section concerning university expectations for the relationship between work and units of credit.\n\n[For faculty and staff information on enrollment, visit Inside Student Services.

You can return to Stanford in Autumn of the following academic year. \n*   After your first year, you can take a Leave of Absence for just one or two quarters, or up to one year at a time, which can then be extended to a second year if you desire.\n*   You\u2019re normally allowed 8 quarters of Leave total during your Stanford career. These can either be taken continuously or spread out over a period of time. \n*   Are you a student on active duty taking a [Leave of Absence for military reasons? (link is external)](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/time-away-stanford-leave-withdraw-return/leaves-absence/military-leaves-absence)  In this case, your Leave can exceed one year, and any Leave quarters related to your military service will not subtract from your 8 total allowed quarters of Leave.  \n*   If you currently have Cardinal Care for your health insurance, you can use your insurance while on Leave. You will be covered through August 31 of the current academic year; see [Vaden's Cardinal Care website (link is external)](https://vaden.stanford.edu/insurance/cardinal-care-overview-and-benefits) for more details.\n*   Your Stanford email will keep working during the duration of your Leave of Absence, [as reported on this Stanford IT site (link is external)](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/accounts/closing-students).\n*   So long as you return on the date indicated on your Leave of Absence form, there's no special process you have to go through to register for courses. Once Axess opens for enrollment for your return quarter, you should be able to enroll as normal. But keep in mind that you'll still have to [apply for housing (link is external)](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/assignments-contracts) and for [financial aid (link is external)](https://financialaid.stanford.edu/undergrad/apply/index.html) (if applicable), and that these processes have their own deadlines.\n*   Need to take more time?

Here are some scenarios depending on when you submit the completed Leave of Absence form:\n\n#### On or before the first day of classes\n\nYou receive a full tuition refund for the quarter. No classes appear on your transcript for that quarter.\n\n#### After the first day of classes, but before the Add/Drop Deadline (end of week 3)\n\nYou receive a pro-rated tuition refund. All courses you may have enrolled in are dropped, and no classes appear on your transcript that quarter.\n\n#### After the Add/Drop deadline (end of week 3) but before the Term Withdrawal deadline (usually end of week 6)\\*\n\n_\\*Please check the_ [_Academic Calendar_ (link is external)](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/calendar/academic-dates) _for this quarter's Term Withdrawal deadline_  \nYou receive a pro-rated refund.

This should not necessarily stop you from taking more time if you need it, but we strongly recommend you contact an Academic Advisor to talk through all potential considerations.\n\nHelp, I've Been Discontinued!\n-----------------------------\n\nIf your Leave of Absence has expired, or you left the university without ever filing for a Leave of Absence, your student status becomes Discontinued.  If you just became Discontinued this quarter, you may still request a [Leave of Absence for Discontinued Students (link is external)](https://registrar.stanford.edu/leave-absence-discontinued-students) before the current quarter ends.  This will change your student status from Discontinued to an active Leave of Absence.  The form and process are very similar to the standard LOA process described above, and will require a meeting with your [Academic Advisor](https://advising.stanford.edu/appointments) and other relevant offices.\n\nPlease note that if you became Discontinued in a previous quarter, you can no longer request a Leave of Absence.
